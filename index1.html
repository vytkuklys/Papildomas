        <p style="padding: 3% 3%; text-align: justify; line-height: 20px;">Ne-doms can use Si consciously for <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">tasks that require categorizing sensory or physical details</span>. For instance, when practicing a skill, one needs to learn methodically and remember mistakes in detail <span style="font-weight: bold;">in order to improve one’s performance over time</span>. However, since Si is the opposing force to Ne, Ne is very prone to overriding and repressing Si and misunderstanding its fundamental nature. While Ne-doms can use Si in very simplistic ways, <span style="color: rosybrown;">they cannot fathom using Si as a “main approach to life”</span> like a dominant function, and <span style="background-color: grey;">therein lies the main source of psychological conflict.</span></p>
